I"ï<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">M</span>y notes for the Coursera course titled <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">Learning how to learn</a> from UC San Diego.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two modes in brain
    <ul>
      <li>Focus mode: When mind is engaged in content with high cognitive processes like reading, analyzing, comparing.</li>
      <li>Diffused mode:  When mind is relaxed, like when one is swimming, walking or just laying down contemplating the clouds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When learning <strong>something new</strong> you need to switch between the two modes.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro technique</a> a great tool for learning, 25 mins of undivided attention and then quick break as a <strong>reward</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Working memory</strong> is not 7 but actually 4 slots (ex. memorizing a phone number)</li>
  <li>Spaced repetition helps to long term memory</li>
  <li>TIP: Tell your brain to dream about what you want learn</li>
  <li><strong>Exercise</strong> increases the number of neurons in brain (research by Rusty et al)</li>
  <li><strong>Chunking</strong> is process by which neurons are united to form a network (like a spider web)</li>
  <li>Need to focus when making a chunk</li>
  <li>Important to always understand <strong>most basic idea</strong> when trying to understand something complex</li>
  <li><strong>Context</strong> is important, so we know <strong>when</strong> to use that which we are learning and also when not to use it.
    <ul>
      <li>Top Down (Big Picture) ‚Äì&gt; <strong>Context</strong> &lt;‚Äì bottom up (chunking)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>TIP: Scan a chapter in a book for about 1 to 2 min before you do <strong>detail reading</strong> this helps create context and a map for brain of what you are about to learn</li>
  <li>TIP: After reading material, instead of re-reading better to <strong>Recall</strong> (research by Korpicke)</li>
  <li>Highlighting can be useful but keep it to a minimum and in addition write small sentence per paragraph to summarize it.</li>
  <li>TIP: Always test yourself (same idea with Recall)
    <ul>
      <li>Mistakes help to learn</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Useful to learn material in different locations. So studying in living room, in library, in classroom is good. Diversify so that when you recall you don‚Äôt only remember a single place</li>
  <li><strong>Motivation</strong> is key when learning, three key chemicals
    <ul>
      <li>Acetylcholine</li>
      <li>Dopamine: Found in neurons, reward learning</li>
      <li>Serotonin: Risk taking behaviour</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstellung_effect">Einstellung</a> like installing a road block</li>
  <li>TIP: Focus on process and not product when studying. A process could be ‚ÄúStudying for 20 min‚Äù instead of ‚Äúfinishing assignment‚Äù (product). Helps <strong>relaxing</strong>. Only focus on <strong>giving your best effort</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Reward is important</strong> to rewire brain to create new habits</li>
  <li>TIP: Write TODO lists day before</li>
  <li>TIP: As soon as you wake up work on a <strong>disliked and important task</strong> even if it is hard</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="memory">Memory</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Using images to memorize. Images connected to right hemisphere and part of our evolution. OUR BRAIN IS GOOT AT IT!!!
    <ul>
      <li>Needs to be funny and <strong>repeated</strong> over several days</li>
      <li>Index cards help</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Handwriting</strong> helps to convert into neural memory structures</li>
  <li>Speaking out loud when studying also helps to set <strong>auditory hooks</strong> in brain. Basically the more senses you use in learning the better it will retain</li>
  <li><strong>Astrocytes</strong> new exciting research and Einstein‚Äôs brain had more than average human</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci">Memory Palace Technique</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Use map of your home or your route to work</li>
      <li>Place funny or strange objects you want to remember along your route, helps remember unrelated items</li>
      <li>In experiments, when people were given 50 items to remember and they used this technique they remembered close to 95%. WOW!!!!</li>
      <li>As an example, for your shopping list, place a giant bread loaf in entrance of house, and then maybe a cracked egg on sofa, the more funny and strange the better</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>TIP: Create <strong>metaphor or analogy</strong>, it helps attaching to existing connections in brain of something we already understand</li>
  <li>People learn better by <strong>discovering themselves</strong> not by someone else telling them.</li>
  <li><strong>Impostor syndrome</strong></li>
  <li>Santiago Ramon y Cajal was a Nobel prize winner in 1906, his secret was <strong>perseverance</strong>, he had poor performance in schools, but he changed the way he thought.</li>
  <li>We can make significant <strong>changes</strong> in brain by changing how we think</li>
  <li>TIP: In a test, first tackle hard problems and then jump to the easy ones when you get stuck, by doing this you are alternating between FOCUSED and DIFFUSSED modes of brain, just like a chef preparing dishes, he lets the chicken in oven while he does other small tasks like cutting a tomato.</li>
  <li>Change in thinking has effect on <strong>cortisol</strong> and stress, so, instead of thinking ‚ÄúThis test has me afraid‚Äù try <strong>‚ÄúThis test has me excited to do my best‚Äù</strong></li>
  <li>Try deep breathing (ex. make your belly grow)</li>
  <li>Try teaching to others what you have learned.</li>
</ul>
