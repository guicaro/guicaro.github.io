<p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, there is alot of really good information in
this page, but as you can see it is very big (the page) so I tried to meke it a little bit
easir for YOU; as you can see, I have put in <strong>BOLD</strong>, and <em>ITALIC</em>
all the clue words, or the words that are important. OK!, and don´t forge to answer the
QUIZ.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Halloween is holiday observed on the evening of
October 31 in most areas of North America and in some areas of Western Europe. The holiday
is symbolically associated with death and the supernatural. Halloween falls on the eve of
All Saints&#146; Day, also known as Allhallows or Hallowmas, a holy day in the Roman
Catholic and Anglican churches. Originally a pagan festival of the dead, All Saints&#146;
Day was established by the Catholic Church in the 9th century to honor Christian saints.
All Souls&#146; Day, a holy day established by the Catholic Church in the 10th century, is
also closely linked to Halloween. All Souls&#146; Day, on November 2, is observed to help
purify the spirits of the dead.</font></p>

<p><big><br>
</big><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Halloween is historically related to similar folk
holidays celebrated in other countries. The Day of the Dead, a Mexican holiday that
coincides with All Souls&#146; Day, blends Roman Catholic and Native American traditions
about the souls of the dead. On the Day of the Dead, Mexicans decorate their homes with
playful imagery of animated human skeletons, leave offerings of food for wandering
spirits, and tend the graves of their deceased relatives. In England, Guy Fawkes&#146;
Day, celebrated on November 5, has largely taken the place of Halloween. On this patriotic
holiday, children light bonfires and burn effigies of Guy Fawkes, a conspirator who tried
to blow up the English Parliament building in 1605.</font><font size="7"></p>

<p align="center"></font><strong><u><big><big><big>Customs</big></big></big></u></strong></p>

<p align="left"><big><br>
</big><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most Halloween festivities are based on folk
beliefs concerning supernatural forces and spirits of the dead. Halloween decorations
typically feature imagery associated with supernatural beings such as witches, werewolves,
vampires, and ghosts. Images thought to symbolize bad omens&#151;such as black cats, bats,
and spiders&#151;are also commonly featured in Halloween decorations.</font></p>

<p><big><br>
</big><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most celebrated Halloween decoration is the<i>
jack-o&#146;-lantern, </i>traditionally a hollowed-out pumpkin carved to resemble a
grotesque face and illuminated by a candle placed inside. The jack-o&#146;-lantern derives
its name from a character in British folktales. According to these tales, the soul of a
deceased person named Jack O&#146;Lantern was barred from both heaven and hell and was
condemned to wander the earth with his lantern. Orange and black, colors associated with
pumpkins and darkness respectively, figure prominently in most Halloween decorations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dressing in costume is one of the most popular Halloween customs,
especially among children. Traditional costumes usually represent witches, ghosts, and
other supernatural beings. However, costumes inspired by contemporary popular culture,
such as politicians or movie characters, have become increasingly common in recent years.
Adults often favor costumes with satirical or humorous overtones.</font></p>

<p><big><br>
</big><font size="4"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trick-or-treating </i>is another Halloween
tradition, in which costumed children go from house to house soliciting candy or other
treats from their neighbors. According to this custom, children greet each homeowner with
the cry &quot;Trick or Treat,&quot; suggesting that some sort of prank will be played
unless treats are provided. Formerly, trick-or-treaters vandalized the house if no treats
were produced or if the treats met with their disapproval. Since the early 20th century,
however, the threat of tricks has been largely ceremonial. Beginning in the 1970s, the
practice of trick-or-treating went into a sharp decline after unsubstantiated rumors
spread about homeowners distributing poisoned Halloween candy to children. Many parents
also became concerned about their children wandering through the neighborhood after dark.
Today, many parents accompany children when they go trick-or-treating.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In some areas of the country, costume parties have replaced
trick-or-treating as the favored form of Halloween entertainment. Hosts of these parties
often hold contests to select the best costume among the guests. Traditional Halloween
diversions have also enjoyed renewed popularity as party activities. For example, many
Halloween parties feature contests of<i> bobbing for apples,</i> a centuries-old game in
which contestants try to retrieve apples floating in a tub of water using only their
mouth. While children&#146;s Halloween parties are generally held in private homes, many
bars and nightclubs sponsor modified versions of such festivities for adults.</font><font size="7"></p>

<p align="center"></font><big><big><strong><big><u>Origins</u></big></strong></big></big></p>

<p align="left"><big><big><strong><big><u><br>
</u></big></strong></big></big><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the ancient
peoples of Europe marked the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter by
celebrating a holiday in late autumn. The most important of these holidays to influence
later Halloween customs was <i>Samhain,</i> a holiday observed by the ancient Celts, a
tribal people who inhabited most of Western and Central Europe in the first millennium BC.
Among the Celts, Samhain marked the end of one year and the beginning of the next. It was
one of four Celtic holidays linked to important transitions in the annual cycle of
seasons.</font></p>

<p><big><br>
</big><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Samhain began at sundown on October 31 and
extended into the following day. According to the Celtic pagan religion, known as
Druidism, the spirits of those who had died in the preceding year roamed the earth on
Samhain evening. The Celts sought to ward off these spirits with offerings of food and
drink. The Celts also built bonfires at sacred hilltop sites and performed rituals, often
involving human and animal sacrifices, to honor Druid deities.</font></p>

<p><big><br>
</big><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the end of the 1st century AD, the Holy Roman
Empire had conquered most of the Celtic lands. In the process of incorporating the Celts
into their empire, the Romans adapted and absorbed some Celtic traditions as part of their
own pagan and Catholic religious observances. In Britain, Romans blended local Samhain
customs with their own pagan harvest festival honoring Pomona, goddess of fruit trees.
Some scholars have suggested that the game of bobbing for apples derives from this Roman
association of the holiday with fruit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pure Celtic influences lingered longer on the western fringes of
Europe, especially in areas that were never brought firmly under Roman control, such as
Ireland, Scotland, and the Bretagne region of northwestern France. In these areas, Samhain
was abandoned only when the local people converted to Christianity during the early Middle
Ages, a period that lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. The Roman Catholic Church
often incorporated modified versions of older religious traditions in order to win
converts. For example, Pope Gregory IV sought to replace Samhain with All Saints&#146; Day
in 835. All Souls&#146; Day, closer in spirit to Samhain and modern Halloween, was first
instituted at a French monastery in 998 and quickly spread throughout Europe. Folk
observances linked to these Christian holidays, including Halloween, thus preserved many
of the ancient Celtic customs associated with Samhain.</font></p>

<p><big><br>
</big><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Halloween traditions thought to be incompatible
with Christianity often became linked with Christian folk beliefs about evil spirits.
Although such superstitions varied a great deal from place to place, many of the
supernatural beings now associated with Halloween became fixed in the popular imagination
during the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance (14th to 17th century). In British
folklore, small magical beings known as fairies became associated with Halloween mischief.
The jack-o&#146;-lantern, originally carved from a large turnip rather than a pumpkin,
originated in medieval Scotland. Various methods of predicting the future, especially
concerning matters of romance and marriage, were also prominent features of Halloween
throughout the British Isles.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between the 15th and 17th centuries, Europe was seized by a
hysterical fear of witches, leading to the persecution of thousands of innocent women.
Witches were thought to ride flying brooms and to assume the form of black cats. These
images of witches soon joined other European superstitions as symbols of Halloween.</font><font size="7"></p>

<p align="center"></font><big><strong><big><u><big>Halloween in the USA</big></u></big></strong></big></p>
<font size="4">

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attitudes toward Halloween varied widely among the various European
groups that settled in North America. New England was initially settled by English
Puritans, members of a strict Protestant sect that rejected Halloween as a Catholic and
pagan holiday (<i>see</i> Puritanism). However, other British colonists successfully
transplanted Halloween traditions in southern colonies such as Virginia and Maryland.
Irish immigrants helped popularize Halloween traditions throughout the United States in
the mid-19th century. As belief in many of the old superstitions waned during the late
19th century, Halloween was increasingly regarded as a children&#146;s holiday.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 19th and early 20th centuries, young people often observed
Halloween by perpetrating minor acts of vandalism, such as overturning sheds or breaking
windows. Beginning in the 1930s, Halloween mischief gradually transformed into the modern
ritual of trick-or-treating. Eventually, Halloween treats were plentiful while tricks
became rare. Nonetheless, the tradition of Halloween pranks still survives. In some areas,
October 30 (one day before Halloween) is called Mischief Night, and vandalism often
reaches dangerous levels. In Detroit, Michigan, Mischief Night&#151;known there as
Devil&#146;s Night&#151;provided the occasion for waves of arson that sometimes destroyed
whole city blocks during the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the 1970s, Halloween celebrations have become increasingly
popular among adults. The Halloween parade in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New
York City features elaborate satirical costumes and drunken revelry. Especially popular
among the local gay population, the Greenwich Village parade serves as a model for many
other adult Halloween celebrations around the country. Similarly boisterous public
Halloween festivities are celebrated in San Francisco, California; New Orleans, Louisiana;
and Key West, Florida.</font></p>
