<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">M</span>y notes for the Coursera course titled <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">Learning how to learn</a> from UC San Diego.</p>

* Two modes in brain
  * Focus mode: When mind is engaged in content with high cognitive processes like reading, analyzing, comparing.
  * Diffused mode:  When mind is relaxed, like when one is swimming, walking or just laying down contemplating the clouds.
* When learning **something new** you need to switch between the two modes.
* [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) a great tool for learning, 25 mins of undivided attention and then quick break as a **reward**.
* **Working memory** is not 7 but actually 4 slots (ex. memorizing a phone number)
* Spaced repetition helps to long term memory
* TIP: Tell your brain to dream about what you want learn
* **Exercise** increases the number of neurons in brain (research by Rusty et al)
* **Chunking** is process by which neurons are united to form a network (like a spider web)
* Need to focus when making a chunk
* Important to always understand **most basic idea** when trying to understand something complex
* **Context** is important, so we know **when** to use that which we are learning and also when not to use it.
  * Top Down (Big Picture) --> **Context** <-- bottom up (chunking)
* TIP: Scan a chapter in a book for about 1 to 2 min before you do **detail reading** this helps create context and a map for brain of what you are about to learn
* TIP: After reading material, instead of re-reading better to **Recall** (research by Korpicke)
* Highlighting can be useful but keep it to a minimum and in addition write small sentence per paragraph to summarize it.
* TIP: Always test yourself (same idea with Recall)
  * Mistakes help to learn
* Useful to learn material in different locations. So studying in living room, in library, in classroom is good. Diversify so that when you recall you don't only remember a single place
* **Motivation** is key when learning, three key chemicals
  * Acetylcholine
  * Dopamine: Found in neurons, reward learning
  * Serotonin: Risk taking behaviour
* [Einstellung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstellung_effect) like installing a road block
* TIP: Focus on process and not product when studying. A process could be "Studying for 20 min" instead of "finishing assignment" (product). Helps **relaxing**. Only focus on **giving your best effort**
* **Reward is important** to rewire brain to create new habits
* TIP: Write TODO lists day before
* TIP: As soon as you wake up work on a **disliked and important task** even if it is hard

## Memory

* Using images to memorize. Images connected to right hemisphere and part of our evolution. OUR BRAIN IS GOOT AT IT!!!
  * Needs to be funny and **repeated** over several days
  * Index cards help
* **Handwriting** helps to convert into neural memory structures
* Speaking out loud when studying also helps to set **auditory hooks** in brain. Basically the more senses you use in learning the better it will retain
* **Astrocytes** new exciting research and Einstein's brain had more than average human
* [Memory Palace Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci)
  * Use map of your home or your route to work
  * Place funny or strange objects you want to remember along your route, helps remember unrelated items
  * In experiments, when people were given 50 items to remember and they used this technique they remembered close to 95%. WOW!!!!
  * As an example, for your shopping list, place a giant bread loaf in entrance of house, and then maybe a cracked egg on sofa, the more funny and strange the better
* TIP: Create **metaphor or analogy**, it helps attaching to existing connections in brain of something we already understand
* People learn better by **discovering themselves** not by someone else telling them.
* **Impostor syndrome**
* Santiago Ramon y Cajal was a Nobel prize winner in 1906, his secret was **perseverance**, he had poor performance in schools, but he changed the way he thought.
* We can make significant **changes** in brain by changing how we think
* TIP: In a test, first tackle hard problems and then jump to the easy ones when you get stuck, by doing this you are alternating between FOCUSED and DIFFUSSED modes of brain, just like a chef preparing dishes, he lets the chicken in oven while he does other small tasks like cutting a tomato.
* Change in thinking has effect on **cortisol** and stress, so, instead of thinking "This test has me afraid" try **"This test has me excited to do my best"**
* Try deep breathing (ex. make your belly grow)
* Try teaching to others what you have learned.
