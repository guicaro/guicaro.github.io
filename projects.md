### HP Labs at Bangalore, India (2009)

At HP Labs I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Krishnan Ramanathan][krishna] on the impact of including eye gaze data in the construction of user profiles, which are later used for recommendations to user. In particular, we explored the problem of finding relevant sections for web documents (text) by using eye gaze data; by accurately extracting those sections that the user read (showing attention and interest)and ignoring the sections that were skimmed, we could accurately create an index of keywords representing user interests around a particular topic. For instance, when looking at the Wikipedia page for "tiger", a user might quickly scan the long page and only read the paragraphs that describe "conservation efforts", thus, it is important to accurately detect this through a robust reading algorithm. This problem and that of interfacing with the eye tracking device were the main areas of focus on this project.

### CS 395T - Modeling Biological Databases (2008)

During fall 2008 I worked with [Dr. Daniel Miranker][mobioslab] on the assesment of the excluded middle idea mentioned in Yianilos’ result, “Excluded Middle Vantage Point Forests for Nearest Neighbor Search” (1999) in terms of the mobios system. This project concerns a parallel implementation of metric-space search methods and developing a forest of search tree instead of a single search tree. Each tree in this forest may be searched in parallel.
